# customer_churn_project

This repository contains a project aimed at helping a company **predict customer churn**. The company in question is an Iranian telecom company, from whose clients we have anonymized data, ranging from number of calls to the charge tier of the user's plan. Using this data, I've trained a machine learning model that predicts with more than **80%** "accuracy" (measured by the **f1-score**) whether a client from this company will churn or not. These are the key points and takeaways

- Dataset available in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/563/iranian+churn+dataset;
- Data Importation and Cleaning using Pandas;
- Exploratory Data Analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn;
- Data Preprocessing using imbalanced-learn;
